# RNA-Seq_analysis


This folder consists of scripts generated during the analysis of
RNA-Seq data from M.Tuberculosis at TAMU-Bioinformatics Lab.

Major sections are:
- normalization
- operon modeling and comparison with published literature
- periodicity analysis of gene expression using fft,metacycle, curve-fitting
- smoothing of gene expression and transposon data using bayesian gaussian regression
- peak assignment for gene expression
- principle component analysis of expression data
- sparse regression optimization and modeling (heuristic â€“ graph algorithms)
- weighted correlation model hard/soft thresholding
- sigma factor motif discovery using finite state machine algorithms
- non linear modeling using radial basis function
- phase analysis using bi clustering algorithms
